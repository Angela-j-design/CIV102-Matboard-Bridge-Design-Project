# CIV102-Matboard-Bridge-Design-Project
The goal of the project was to maximize structural efficiency by improving resistance to tension, compression, shear, and multiple buckling failure modes. Design decisions were guided by structural analysis and engineering principles including bending moment behavior, shear force distribution, and cross-sectional optimization
